<h3>About me</h3>
<p><img src = "images/math-1.jpg" id ="mathbaby">My name is Matthew Cho, a sophomore at <a href = "https://sduhsd.net" target = "_blank">Canyon Crest Academy</a>. I am 5â€™6 and 15 years old. My parents are both 100% Korean and I was born in Atlanta Georgia. I have just recently found out I am slightly lactose intolerant so I had to switch to lactose free milk. My favorite subject is math.

<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
<p><img src = "images/_119546661_gettyimages-1294130887.jpg" id = "sonnyboy">I like sports in general and athletes. My favorite sport to play is soccer. My favorite soccer players include <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Heung-min" target = "_blank">Son Heung-min</a>, Karou Mitoma, and Ji-sung Park. In my free time I like to listen to music, go on my phone, and watch movies. I enjoy travelling and meeting new people.

<h3>My music taste</h3>
<p><img src = "images/images.jpeg" id = "2hollis">I like to expand my music taste palette every month. During summer, I made new friends who put me onto kpop by forcing me to watch the idol survival show, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_II_Planet" target = "_blank">Boys 2 Planet</a>. My favorite groups are new jeans, twice, and aespa. Last month I got really into hyperpop, with my favorite artists including 2hollis, The Deep, Tonser, kimj, Effie, and Glaive. The two artists I have been listening to the most are 2hollis and Feng.
