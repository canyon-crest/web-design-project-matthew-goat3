          <img src="images/math-1.jpg" id="mathbaby" alt="math baby">
          My name is Matthew Cho, a sophomore at <a href="https://sduhsd.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canyon Crest Academy</a>. I am 5’6 and 15 years old. My parents are both 100% Korean and I was born in Atlanta, Georgia. I have just recently found out I am slightly lactose intolerant so I had to switch to lactose-free milk. My favorite subject is math.

          I like sports in general and athletes. My favorite sport to play is soccer. My favorite soccer players include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Heung-min" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Son Heung-min</a>, Karou Mitoma, and Ji-sung Park. In my free time I like to listen to music, go on my phone, and watch movies. I enjoy travelling and meeting new people.

          I like to expand my music taste palette every month. During summer, I made new friends who put me onto kpop by watching the idol survival show, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_II_Planet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boys 2 Planet</a>. My favorite groups are NewJeans, TWICE, and Aespa. Last month I got really into hyperpop, with favorite artists including 2hollis, The Deep, Tonser, kimj, Effie, and Glaive.
